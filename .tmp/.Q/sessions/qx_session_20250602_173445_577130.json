    "content": "Thank you for clarifying. I understand now that you are referring to the client application you are using to interact with me, which is displaying the \"Approve All\" mode message but still prompting for approvals.\n\nAs an AI model, I operate by receiving instructions and executing them using the provided tools. The \"Approve All\" mode, and the subsequent approval prompts, are features of the **client application** you are using (the one running in your terminal), not something I directly control or am aware of through my tools.\n\nWhen I execute a tool (like `write_file_tool` or `execute_shell_tool`), I simply send the command to the client application. It is the client application's responsibility to handle the approval flow based on its internal settings (like \"Approve All\" mode) before passing the command to the underlying system.\n\nTherefore, if the client application is still prompting you for approval despite indicating that \"Approve All\" mode is active, it suggests an issue within the client application itself. I cannot directly debug or fix the behavior of your client application's user interface or its approval mechanism.\n\nMy recommendation would be to:\n1.  **Verify the client application's documentation** regarding the \"Approve All\" mode to ensure you are activating it correctly.\n2.  **Report this as a bug** to the developers of the client application, as it appears to be a discrepancy between the stated mode and the actual behavior.\n\nI am ready to assist with any tasks you have for me, but I cannot resolve issues related to the client application's UI or approval prompts.",
