# V2 Workflow Implementation Status

## Summary
The V2 workflow implementation using langgraph-supervisor library has been created but requires additional work to be fully functional.

## Completed
1. ✅ Created `langgraph_supervisor_v2.py` with simplified implementation
2. ✅ Created adapter modules:
   - `langgraph_model_adapter.py` - Wraps QX's LiteLLM agents for LangChain
   - `langgraph_tool_adapter.py` - Bridges QX's tool plugin system
   - `langgraph_interrupt_adapter.py` - Handles interrupts through console manager
3. ✅ Created `workflow_manager.py` to switch between V1/V2 implementations
4. ✅ Created `test_v2_workflow.py` for testing
5. ✅ Fixed import issues (create_react_agent from langgraph.prebuilt)

## Issues Found
1. **MCP Manager Initialization**: Need to properly get MCP manager from config_manager
2. **API Key Validation**: Test environment doesn't have API keys configured
3. **Agent Config Modification**: Cannot modify agent_config.name directly (likely immutable)
4. **Supervisor Model Creation**: Need proper way to create supervisor model

## Next Steps
1. Fix MCP manager initialization to use existing instance from config_manager
2. Handle API key validation gracefully in test environments
3. Create proper supervisor agent config without modifying existing configs
4. Add integration tests with mock API responses
5. Implement proper interrupt handling for GraphInterrupt
6. Test with actual QX environment (requires QX_USE_V2_WORKFLOW=true)

## How to Test
```bash
# Set environment variable to use V2 workflow
export QX_USE_V2_WORKFLOW=true

# Run QX in team mode
qx --team

# Or run the test script (requires API keys)
python test_v2_workflow.py
```

## Architecture Benefits
- Uses langgraph-supervisor library's built-in patterns
- Simpler code structure
- Better separation of concerns
- Maintains all QX constraints (liteLLM, tool plugins, console manager, etc.)
