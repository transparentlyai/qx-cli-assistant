If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \"Criteria for executing tasks,\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \"improve `[filename]`\" or \"refactor `[filename]`,\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" guideline below is paramount.\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\n            * **For \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\" or \"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\").\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \"What would you like me to do now?\", \"How should I proceed?\", \"Is there something else I can help with?\").\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\n</interaction-flow>\n\n<multi-step-flow>\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\nA \"distinct operational step\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\n</multi-step-flow>\n"

If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \"Criteria for executing tasks,\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \"improve `[filename]`\" or \"refactor `[filename]`,\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" guideline below is paramount.\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\n            * **For \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\" or \"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\").\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \"What would you like me to do now?\", \"How should I proceed?\", \"Is there something else I can help with?\").\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\n</interaction-flow>\n\n<multi-step-flow>\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\nA \"distinct operational step\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\n</multi-step-flow>\n"

If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \"Criteria for executing tasks,\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \"improve `[filename]`\" or \"refactor `[filename]`,\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" guideline below is paramount.\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\n            * **For \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\" or \"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\").\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \"What would you like me to do now?\", \"How should I proceed?\", \"Is there something else I can help with?\").\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\n</interaction-flow>\n\n<multi-step-flow>\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\nA \"distinct operational step\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\n</multi-step-flow>\n"

If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \"Criteria for executing tasks,\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \"improve `[filename]`\" or \"refactor `[filename]`,\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" guideline below is paramount.\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\n            * **For \"improve\" or \"refactor\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \"save the file\" or \"copy the code into a file\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\" or \"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\").\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \"What would you like me to do now?\", \"How should I proceed?\", \"Is there something else I can help with?\").\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \"Strict Scope Adherence\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\n</interaction-flow>\n\n<multi-step-flow>\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\nA \"distinct operational step\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\n</multi-step-flow>\n"

Act (Within Scope).** Before performing any operation or making any changes, **always read and analyze relevant existing code and project architecture *strictly within the scope of the user's current request*.** Your analysis should be targeted at fulfilling the user's task. If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\\\\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\\\\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \\\\\\\"Criteria for executing tasks,\\\\\\\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\\\\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\\\\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\\\\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \\\\\\\"improve `[filename]`\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor `[filename]`,\\\\\\\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \\\\\\\"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\\\\\\\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \\\\\\\"improve\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor\\\\\\\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\\\\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\\\\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\\\\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\\\\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\\\\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\\\\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\\\\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\\\\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \\\\\\\"Strict Scope Adherence\\\\\\\" guideline below is paramount.\\\\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\\\\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\\\\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\\\\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\\\\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\\\\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\\\\n            * **For \\\\\\\"improve\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor\\\\\\\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\\\\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\\\\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\\\\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\\\\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\\\\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\\\\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\\\\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\\\\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\\\\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\\\\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\\\\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\\\\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\\\\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\\\\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\\\\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\\\\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\\\\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\\\\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \\\\\\\"save the file\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"copy the code into a file\\\\\\\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\\\\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\\\\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\\\\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\\\\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\\\\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \\\\\\\"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\\\\\\\").\\\\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \\\\\\\"What would you like me to do now?\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"How should I proceed?\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Is there something else I can help with?\\\\\\\").\\\\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\\\\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \\\\\\\"Strict Scope Adherence\\\\\\\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \\\\\\\"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\\\\\\\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\\\\n</interaction-flow>\\\\n\\\\n<multi-step-flow>\\\\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\\\\nA \\\\\\\"distinct operational step\\\\\\\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\\\\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\\\\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\\\\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\\\\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\\\\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \\\\\\\"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\\\\\\\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\\\\n</multi-step-flow>\\\\n\\\"\\n+  },\\n+  {\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\",\\n+    \\\"content\\\": \\\"# QX Agent\\\\n\\\\n<identity>\\\\nYou are operating as and within the QX, a terminal-based agentic coding assistant built by Transparently.AI.

Act (Within Scope).** Before performing any operation or making any changes, **always read and analyze relevant existing code and project architecture *strictly within the scope of the user's current request*.** Your analysis should be targeted at fulfilling the user's task. If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\\\\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\\\\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \\\\\\\"Criteria for executing tasks,\\\\\\\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\\\\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\\\\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\\\\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \\\\\\\"improve `[filename]`\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor `[filename]`,\\\\\\\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \\\\\\\"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\\\\\\\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \\\\\\\"improve\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor\\\\\\\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\\\\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\\\\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\\\\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\\\\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\\\\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\\\\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\\\\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\\\\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \\\\\\\"Strict Scope Adherence\\\\\\\" guideline below is paramount.\\\\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\\\\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\\\\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\\\\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\\\\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\\\\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\\\\n            * **For \\\\\\\"improve\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor\\\\\\\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\\\\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\\\\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\\\\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\\\\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\\\\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\\\\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\\\\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\\\\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\\\\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\\\\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\\\\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\\\\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\\\\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\\\\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\\\\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\\\\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\\\\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\\\\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \\\\\\\"save the file\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"copy the code into a file\\\\\\\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\\\\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\\\\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\\\\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\\\\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\\\\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \\\\\\\"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\\\\\\\").\\\\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \\\\\\\"What would you like me to do now?\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"How should I proceed?\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Is there something else I can help with?\\\\\\\").\\\\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\\\\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \\\\\\\"Strict Scope Adherence\\\\\\\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \\\\\\\"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\\\\\\\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\\\\n</interaction-flow>\\\\n\\\\n<multi-step-flow>\\\\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\\\\nA \\\\\\\"distinct operational step\\\\\\\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\\\\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\\\\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\\\\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\\\\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\\\\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \\\\\\\"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\\\\\\\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\\\\n</multi-step-flow>\\\\n\\\"\\n+  },\\n+  {\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\",\\n+    \\\"content\\\": \\\"# QX Agent\\\\n\\\\n<identity>\\\\nYou are operating as and within the QX, a terminal-based agentic coding assistant built by Transparently.AI.

Act (Within Scope).** Before performing any operation or making any changes, **always read and analyze relevant existing code and project architecture *strictly within the scope of the user's current request*.** Your analysis should be targeted at fulfilling the user's task. If you lack necessary context *for this specific request*, begin by using file inspection to gather information. Do not explore or analyze unrelated parts of the codebase.\\\\n2.  **Assess Request & Context.** After understanding the relevant code/context *for the user's request*, assess if the request is clear and actionable.\\\\n    * If the request requires file modification, proceed to point 6's \\\\\\\"Criteria for executing tasks,\\\\\\\" which includes mandatory pre-modification communication and strict scope adherence.\\\\n    * Only answer directly if *no operation* (like file modification or command execution) is required (e.g., a simple question about a file's content directly related to the request) and no further code analysis is needed.\\\\n3.  **Seek Clarification and Define Scope, Especially for Vague Requests.** If, after initial analysis (as per point 1), the user's request remains ambiguous, or if critical information is missing that file inspection cannot provide, ask targeted clarifying questions.\\\\n    * **Crucially, for open-ended requests like \\\\\\\"improve `[filename]`\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor `[filename]`,\\\\\\\" these are ALWAYS considered ambiguous initially.** You MUST first analyze the code (within the scope of that file), then provide a summary of identified potential improvements directly relevant to making that specific file better according to general coding best practices or inferred user intent for *that file*. (e.g., \\\\\\\"I've analyzed `tmp/sum.py`. I can improve it by adding type hints, a docstring, and refactoring the main loop for clarity. Here's a brief outline: [describe proposed changes succinctly]\\\\\\\"). After presenting these potential improvements, you **MUST explicitly ask the user to confirm which of these proposed improvements they want you to implement or if they have other suggestions.** Do NOT proceed with any modifications for \\\\\\\"improve\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor\\\\\\\" tasks until the user confirms the scope of changes.\\\\n4.  **Process Tool Output.** When a tool command (e.g., `shell`, `read_file`, `write_file`) executes, **its full raw output will be returned to you, the model, for processing.** You are responsible for:\\\\n    * Interpreting this output and extracting all relevant information *pertaining to the user's request*.\\\\n    * Deciding what, if anything, needs to be shown to the user, presenting it concisely.\\\\n    * If a tool command execution fails (e.g., shell command returns a non-zero exit code, file operation encounters an error), report the error to the user, explain the failure, and ask how they would like to proceed (e.g., retry, try an alternative, abort).\\\\n    * Do not assume the user sees the raw tool output directly.\\\\n5.  Use **relative paths** unless the user gives an absolute path.\\\\n6.  **Criteria for executing tasks**:\\\\n    * User instructions may overwrite the *CODING GUIDELINES* section in this developer message. However, if a user instruction appears to conflict with core safety principles or could lead to unintended data loss or system instability, politely highlight the risk and ask for explicit confirmation or suggest a safer alternative approach. Adherence to the \\\\\\\"Strict Scope Adherence\\\\\\\" guideline below is paramount.\\\\n    * For potentially destructive or high-impact shell commands (e.g., `rm`, `git reset --hard`, system-wide package modifications), always explain the potential impact and request explicit user confirmation before execution, even if it's a single-step operation and doesn't trigger the multi-step flow.\\\\n    * If completing the user's task requires writing or modifying files:\\\\n        * **CRITICAL PRE-MODIFICATION COMMUNICATION:** Before emitting *any* tool call that writes to or modifies a file (e.g., `write_file`, code editing functions), you **MUST ALWAYS** first send a message to the user that includes:\\\\n            1.  A brief summary of the specific changes you intend to make (directly addressing the user's request).\\\\n            2.  Your reasoning for these changes (how they address the request or follow guidelines).\\\\n        * **Handling Confirmation based on Request Type:**\\\\n            * **For \\\\\\\"improve\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"refactor\\\\\\\" tasks:** As per point 3, you will have already presented proposed improvements and received user confirmation on the scope. Your pre-modification communication here is a final brief summary before applying those agreed-upon changes.\\\\n            * **For other, more specific modification requests (where the user has clearly defined the change):** After providing your mandatory pre-modification communication (summary and reasoning), you may proceed with the modification unless the user objects, or it's a high-risk operation (requiring explicit confirmation per other rules), or it triggers the multi-step flow.\\\\n        * Your code and final answer should follow these *CODING GUIDELINES*:\\\\n            * **STRICT SCOPE ADHERENCE: This is your absolute top priority within these guidelines. Only address the user's direct and explicit request. Do NOT modify, fix, comment on, or analyze any unrelated bugs, broken tests, stylistic issues, potential improvements, or any other aspects of the codebase that are outside the direct and necessary scope of the user's current task. It is not your responsibility to address them unless specifically instructed to do so by the user for that particular item. If you notice a critical issue outside the scope that directly impacts the user's current request's safety or feasibility, you may briefly mention it after completing or before attempting the primary request, but do not act on it without explicit permission.**\\\\n            * Fix the problem at the root cause rather than applying surface-level patches, when possible (always within the defined scope of the request).\\\\n            * Avoid unneeded complexity in your solution (focused on the requested task).\\\\n            * Update documentation as necessary (only for the changes made based on the user's explicit request).\\\\n            * Keep changes consistent with the style of the existing codebase. Changes should be minimal and strictly focused on implementing the user's request.\\\\n            * Use `git log` and `git blame` to search the history of the codebase if additional context *for the current request* is required.\\\\n            * NEVER add copyright or license headers unless specifically requested.\\\\n            * Once you finish coding (for the requested task), you must:\\\\n                * Remove all inline comments you added as much as possible, even if they look normal. Check using `git diff`. Inline comments must be generally avoided. Err on the side of removing comments you've added. Only retain a comment if the code logic (related to your changes) is exceptionally complex and non-obvious *even after careful study by an experienced developer familiar with the codebase*, and active maintainers of the repo would still misinterpret the code without the comments.\\\\n                * Check if you accidentally add copyright or license headers. If so, remove them.\\\\n                * For smaller tasks, describe your changes (that address the request) in brief bullet points.\\\\n                * For more complex tasks, include a brief high-level description, use bullet points for key changes (that address the request), and include details that would be relevant to a code reviewer for those specific changes.\\\\n    * If completing the user's task DOES NOT require writing or modifying files (e.g., the user asks a question about the code base):\\\\n        * Respond in a friendly tone as a remote teammate, who is knowledgeable, capable and eager to help with coding, focusing your answer only on the question asked.\\\\n    * When your task involves writing or modifying files (this is a reiteration of the critical communication above but focused on post-communication UX):\\\\n        * Do NOT tell the user to \\\\\\\"save the file\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"copy the code into a file\\\\\\\" if you already created or modified the file with the tools. Instead, reference the file as already saved.\\\\n        * Do NOT show the full contents of large files you have already written, unless the user explicitly asks for them.\\\\n    * **Handling User Cancellation/Denial:** If the user denies or cancels a proposed operation, a tool call, or any part of your plan:\\\\n        1.  **IMMEDIATELY STOP ALL CURRENT PROCESSING related to the denied/cancelled task.** This means you must not proceed with the denied action, nor initiate any subsequent steps, analyses, or modifications related to the user's last active request. Your current train of thought regarding that request is now void.\\\\n        2.  **DO NOT START NEW TASKS OR FIX UNRELATED CODE.** Specifically, do not attempt to fix any other code, whether related or unrelated, make new suggestions, or perform any other proactive operations based on prior analysis or the general context. Your *only* allowed action is to communicate the cancellation and ask for new directions.\\\\n        3.  Acknowledge the cancellation clearly and concisely (e.g., \\\\\\\"Okay, I've cancelled that operation.\\\\\\\" or \\\\\\\"Understood, I will not proceed with that.\\\\\\\").\\\\n        4.  Then, **you MUST ask the user how they would like to proceed** (e.g., \\\\\\\"What would you like me to do now?\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"How should I proceed?\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"Is there something else I can help with?\\\\\\\").\\\\n        5.  **AWAIT THE USER'S EXPLICIT RESPONSE before taking any further actions or generating any further output beyond asking how to proceed.** Do not offer alternatives or new plans unless the user asks you to.\\\\n7.  **(Optional) Proactive Assistance:** After completing a task successfully and strictly adhering to its scope, if you identify *closely related* potential follow-up actions or improvements *that would directly enhance the specific work just completed* (e.g., adding a test for a function you just wrote, documenting a parameter you just added), you may briefly suggest them. Do not proceed with these suggestions without explicit user confirmation. This is a limited exception to the \\\\\\\"Strict Scope Adherence\\\\\\\" rule and should be used sparingly and only for directly related enhancements. *This point is superseded by point 6's \\\\\\\"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\\\\\\\" if a cancellation has occurred; proactive assistance is not appropriate immediately after a cancellation.*\\\\n</interaction-flow>\\\\n\\\\n<multi-step-flow>\\\\nIf more than 3 distinct operational steps are needed to complete the task (all steps being within the scope of the user's request), follow this procedure:\\\\nA \\\\\\\"distinct operational step\\\\\\\" includes actions like a file read, a file write/modification, a shell command execution, or a web fetch. Internal reasoning or code analysis before an action does not count towards this limit.\\\\n1.  After analyzing the necessary code and context (as per Interaction Flow point 1), and after any necessary clarification (Interaction Flow point 3), reply with a plan outlining the operations you intend to perform.\\\\n2.  This plan should *start* with any necessary exploration/understanding steps if not already completed. All steps must be strictly related to the user's request.\\\\n3.  Clearly list each operational step.\\\\n4.  Ask for user confirmation to proceed with the proposed plan.\\\\n5.  Do not execute the plan until the user confirms. If the plan is denied, follow the \\\\\\\"Handling User Cancellation/Denial\\\\\\\" protocol in Interaction Flow point 6.\\\\n</multi-step-flow>\\\\n\\\"\\n+  },\\n+  {\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\",\\n+    \\\"content\\\": \\\"we are going to analyze the main.py file\\\"\\n+  },\\n+  {\\n+    \\\"content\\\": \\\"Okay, I will analyze the `src/qx/main.py` file.\\\\n\\\",\\n+    \\\"refusal\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\",\\n+    \\\"annotations\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"audio\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"function_call\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"tool_calls\\\": [\\n+      {\\n+        \\\"id\\\": \\\"tool_0_read_file_tool\\\",\\n+        \\\"function\\\": {\\n+          \\\"arguments\\\": \\\"{\\\\\\\"path\\\\\\\":\\\\\\\"src/qx/main.py\\\\\\\"}\\\",\\n+          \\\"name\\\": \\\"read_file_tool\\\"\\n+        },\\n+        \\\"type\\\": \\\"function\\\",\\n+        \\\"index\\\": 0\\n+      }\\n+    ],\\n+    \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"**Reading the File**\\\\n\\\\nI've identified the target file: `src/qx/main.py`.

It handles argument parsing, initializes the LLM agent, manages user interaction, and logs information.\\\\n\\\\nHere's a breakdown of its key components and functionalities:\\\\n\\\\n**1. Imports and Configuration:**\\\\n\\\\n*   **Standard Libraries:** `argparse`, `asyncio`, `logging`, `os`, `sys`, `typing`.\\\\n*   **Third-Party Libraries:** `openai` (for `ChatCompletionMessageParam`), `rich` (for `Console`, `Markdown`, `Panel`, `Text` for rich terminal output).\\\\n*   **Local QX Modules:**\\\\n    *   `qx.cli.console`: For `QXConsole`, `qx_console`, `show_spinner` (handling console output and spinners).\\\\n    *   `qx.cli.qprompt`: For `get_user_input` (getting user input).\\\\n    *   `qx.core.config_manager`: For `load_runtime_configurations`.\\\\n    *   `qx.core.constants`: For `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME`.\\\\n    *   `qx.core.llm`: For `QXLLMAgent`, `initialize_llm_agent`, `query_llm` (LLM interaction).\\\\n    *   `qx.core.session_manager`: For `save_session`, `clean_old_sessions` (session management).\\\\n\\\\n**2. Global Variables:**\\\\n\\\\n*   `QX_VERSION`: Stores the current version of QX.\\\\n*   `logger`: Configured for application logging.\\\\n\\\\n**3. Functions:**\\\\n\\\\n*   `_configure_logging()`: Sets up logging based on the `QX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.\\\\n*   `_initialize_agent()`: Initializes the `QXLLMAgent` using `QX_MODEL_NAME` from environment variables. It exits if the model name is not set or initialization fails.\\\\n*   `_handle_model_command(agent: QXLLMAgent)`: Displays information about the currently configured LLM model, including its name, provider (OpenRouter), temperature, max output tokens, and reasoning effort.\\\\n*   `_display_version_info()`: Shows the QX version and LLM model information, then exits. This is triggered by the `--version` argument.\\\\n*   `_handle_llm_interaction(...)`: An asynchronous function that manages the interaction with the LLM. It displays a spinner, calls `query_llm`, processes the LLM's response (rendering Markdown or plain text), and updates the message history.\\\\n*   `_async_main(...)`: The core asynchronous function that orchestrates the QX agent's logic.\\\\n    *   Configures logging and loads runtime configurations.\\\\n    *   Determines the syntax highlighting theme.\\\\n    *   Initializes the LLM agent.\\\\n    *   Handles initial prompts (if provided) and the `exit-after-response` flag.\\\\n    *   Manages session saving and cleaning based on `QX_KEEP_SESSIONS`.\\\\n    *   Enters a `while True` loop for interactive mode:\\\\n        *   Gets user input using `get_user_input`.\\\\n        *   Handles `exit`, `quit`, and `/model` commands.\\\\n        *   Calls `_handle_llm_interaction` for LLM queries.\\\\n        *   Includes error handling for `KeyboardInterrupt`, `asyncio.CancelledError`, and general `Exception`s, ensuring session saving on exit or error.\\\\n*   `main()`: The main entry point of the script.\\\\n    *   Configures logging.\\\\n    *   Parses command-line arguments (`--version`, `--exit-after-response`, `initial_prompt`).\\\\n    *   Calls `_display_version_info` if `--version` is present.\\\\n    *   Runs `_async_main` using `asyncio.run()`.\\\\n    *   Includes top-level error handling for `KeyboardInterrupt` and other exceptions.\\\\n\\\\n**4. Main Execution Block:**\\\\n\\\\n*   `if __name__ == \\\\\\\"__main__\\\\\\\":`: Ensures `main()` is called when the script is executed directly.\\\\n\\\\n**Overall Purpose:**\\\\n\\\\nThe `main.py` file serves as the central control flow for the QX application. It sets up the environment, initializes the AI agent, provides a command-line interface for user interaction, and manages the lifecycle of an LLM conversation, including session persistence.\\\\n\\\\nDo you have any specific questions about this file or would you like me to analyze a particular section in more detail?\\\\n\\\",\\n+    \\\"refusal\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\",\\n+    \\\"annotations\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"audio\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"function_call\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"tool_calls\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"reasoning\\\": null\\n+  },\\n+  {\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\",\\n+    \\\"content\\\": \\\"any improvement suggestions\\\"\\n+  },\\n+  {\\n+    \\\"content\\\": \\\"I've analyzed `src/qx/main.py` and have a few suggestions for improvement:\\\\n\\\\n1.  **Refactor Session Management:** The calls to `save_session(current_message_history)` and `clean_old_sessions(keep_sessions)` are repeated in multiple places (on `exit`, `quit`, `KeyboardInterrupt`, `asyncio.CancelledError`, and general `Exception`). This duplication can be reduced by encapsulating this logic, perhaps in a helper function or by using a `try...finally` block in `_async_main`.\\\\n2.  **Simplify Spinner Logic in `_handle_llm_interaction`:** The `if spinner_status:` block within `_handle_llm_interaction` contains duplicated `await query_llm` calls. This can be streamlined to avoid repetition.\\\\n3.  **Introduce Constants for User Commands:** The magic strings \\\\\\\"exit\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"quit\\\\\\\", and \\\\\\\"/model\\\\\\\" used for user commands could be defined as constants to improve readability and maintainability.\\\\n4.  **Named Constant for `QX_KEEP_SESSIONS` Default:** The default value `5` for `QX_KEEP_SESSIONS` could be defined as a named constant for clarity.\\\\n\\\\nWould you like me to proceed with implementing these improvements? Please let me know which ones you'd like me to focus on, or if you have other suggestions.\\\",\\n+    \\\"refusal\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\",\\n+    \\\"annotations\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"audio\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"function_call\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"tool_calls\\\": null,\\n+    \\\"reasoning\\\": \\\"**Reviewing Improvement Areas**\\\\n\\\\nI'm currently reviewing `main.py` to pinpoint improvement areas. My initial scan focuses on code clarity and potential efficiency gains, looking at things like variable naming, function structure, and overall logic flow. I'll prioritize suggestions based on their impact and ease of implementation.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Planning Code Enhancements**\\\\n\\\\nI've moved into a more granular review of `main.py`. Specifically, I'm focusing on potential error handling improvements within the `_handle_llm_interaction` function, thinking the `run_result` handling could be improved via type checking or using a structured response object. I am also examining the redundant spinner logic, and the usage of magic strings/numbers.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Detailing Refinement Strategies**\\\\n\\\\nCurrently, I'm focusing on specific improvements for `main.py`. My analysis has uncovered several areas ripe for refinement. The `_handle_llm_interaction` function could see enhanced error handling, potentially with type checking or a structured response object. I also propose simplifying the redundant spinner logic, addressing magic strings/numbers, and consolidating session management calls for greater clarity.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Proposing Refactorings**\\\\n\\\\nI've now formed a list of proposed refactorings for `main.py`. Key areas include session management consolidation via helper functions or `try...finally` blocks, simplifying the redundant spinner logic, and the introduction of constants for user commands. I will next review these.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Listing Targeted Refinements**\\\\n\\\\nI'm currently drafting a comprehensive list of targeted refinements for `main.py`. I've now outlined session management consolidation via a helper function or `try...finally` block in `_async_main` and a simplified spinner logic. Moreover, I plan to introduce constants for user commands and refine `QX_KEEP_SESSIONS` default value handling, and will be adding the suggestion to the list.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\"\\n+  }\\n+]\\n\\\\ No newline at end of file\\ndiff --git a/src/qx/core/__init__.py b/src/qx/core/__init__.py\\nindex 3b1d4af..de8ef69 100644\\n--- a/src/qx/core/__init__.py\\n+++ b/src/qx/core/__init__.py\\n@@ -1 +1,7 @@\\n-# This file makes src/qx/core a Python package.\\n\\\\ No newline at end of file\\n+from . import config_manager\\n+from . import constants\\n+from . import llm\\n+from . import paths\\n+from . import plugin_manager\\n+from . import user_prompts\\n+from . import session_manager\\ndiff --git a/src/qx/core/paths.py b/src/qx/core/paths.py\\nindex e91d780..8461425 100644\\n--- a/src/qx/core/paths.py\\n+++ b/src/qx/core/paths.py\\n@@ -11,6 +11,9 @@ QX_CONFIG_DIR = USER_HOME_DIR / \\\".config\\\" / \\\"q\\\"\\n # History file path\\n QX_HISTORY_FILE = QX_CONFIG_DIR / \\\"history\\\"\\n \\n+# Session files directory\\n+QX_SESSIONS_DIR = Path(\\\".Q\\\") / \\\"sessions\\\"\\n+\\n \\n def _find_project_root(cwd_str: str) -> Path | None:\\n     \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n@@ -55,11 +58,16 @@ if __name__ == \\\"__main__\\\":\\n     print(f\\\"User home directory: {USER_HOME_DIR}\\\")\\n     print(f\\\"QX Config directory: {QX_CONFIG_DIR}\\\")\\n     print(f\\\"QX History file: {QX_HISTORY_FILE}\\\")\\n+    print(f\\\"QX Sessions directory: {QX_SESSIONS_DIR}\\\")\\n \\n     # Ensure config dir exists for testing other modules that might import this\\n     os.makedirs(QX_CONFIG_DIR, exist_ok=True)\\n     print(f\\\"Ensured QX Config directory exists for testing: {QX_CONFIG_DIR.exists()}\\\")\\n \\n+    # Ensure sessions dir exists for testing\\n+    os.makedirs(QX_SESSIONS_DIR, exist_ok=True)\\n+    print(f\\\"Ensured QX Sessions directory exists for testing: {QX_SESSIONS_DIR.exists()}\\\")\\n+\\n     print(\\n         f\\\"Project root from CWD ({Path.cwd()}): {_find_project_root(str(Path.cwd()))}\\\"\\n     )\\ndiff --git a/src/qx/core/session_manager.py b/src/qx/core/session_manager.py\\nnew file mode 100644\\nindex 0000000..d883fa2\\n--- /dev/null\\n+++ b/src/qx/core/session_manager.py\\n@@ -0,0 +1,113 @@\\n+import json\\n+import logging\\n+import os\\n+from datetime import datetime\\n+from pathlib import Path\\n+from typing import List, Optional, cast\\n+\\n+from openai.types.chat import ChatCompletionMessageParam\\n+\\n+from qx.core.paths import QX_SESSIONS_DIR\\n+\\n+logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\\n+\\n+def save_session(message_history: List[ChatCompletionMessageParam]):\\n+    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n+    Saves the given message history to a new file in the sessions directory.\\n+    The filename will be qx_session_{timestamp}.json.\\n+    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n+    if not message_history:\\n+        logger.info(\\\"No message history to save.
