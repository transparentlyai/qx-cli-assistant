## Sprint 1: Initial Setup & Stage 1 Implementation

**Date:** $(date +'%Y-%m-%d')

**Objective:** Complete Stage 1: Basic CLI loop with PydanticAI and Vertex AI.

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Environment Setup (`.env`):**
    *   Created `.env` file.
    *   Added `QX_MODEL_NAME="google-vertex:gemini-2.0-flash"`.
    *   Added placeholder `QX_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID="your-gcp-project-id"`.
    *   Added placeholder `QX_VERTEX_LOCATION="your-gcp-region"`.
    *   Included a comment about `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`.

2.  **Core Application (`src/main.py`):**
    *   Created `src/main.py`.
    *   Implemented main asynchronous loop using `asyncio`.
    *   Integrated `python-dotenv` to load environment variables (`QX_MODEL_NAME`, `QX_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`, `QX_VERTEX_LOCATION`).
    *   Initialized PydanticAI `Agent` with `QX_MODEL_NAME`.
    *   Added basic error handling for missing environment variables and agent initialization.
    *   Used `rich.console.Console` and `rich.prompt.Prompt` for user interaction ("Q>" prompt).
    *   Implemented "exit" / "quit" commands to terminate the application.
    *   Handled `KeyboardInterrupt` for graceful exit.
    *   Agent execution (`agent.run()`) is called with user input, and the output is printed.

3.  **Dependency Management (`pyproject.toml` & `uv`):**
    *   Confirmed `pyproject.toml` already included `pydantic-ai[vertexai]>=0.2.3` and `python-dotenv>=1.1.0`. No changes were needed.
    *   Ran `uv sync` to ensure dependencies are correctly installed and `uv.lock` is up-to-date.

**Next Steps:**

*   User to update `.env` with actual `QX_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` and `QX_VERTEX_LOCATION`.
*   User to set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` if not already configured in their environment.
*   Test the application by running `python src/main.py`.
*   Proceed to Stage 2 as per `.Q/project-stages.md`.

**Notes:**

*   The PydanticAI agent initialization relies on the Google Cloud client libraries to automatically pick up project ID and location if `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` is correctly set. The `QX_VERTEX_PROJECT_ID` and `QX_VERTEX_LOCATION` environment variables are loaded in `main.py` primarily for informational display and explicit error checking before agent initialization.
