# Project QX Log

## Session 2024-07-19 (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Implement selectable Rich CLI themes and fix related style errors.

**Activities:**

1.  **Add `DEFAULT_CLI_THEME` Constant:**
    *   Added `DEFAULT_CLI_THEME = "dark"` to `src/qx/core/constants.py`.
2.  **Implement Theme Loading in `main.py`:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/main.py` to load `CLI_THEME` env var, select theme, and initialize `q_console` with it.
    *   Passed themed `q_console` to `initialize_llm_agent` and `query_llm`.
3.  **Adapt `llm.py` for Themed Console:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/core/llm.py` to accept and use the passed-in themed console.
4.  **Adapt `qprompt.py` for Themed Console:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/cli/qprompt.py` to correctly type-hint the passed console.
5.  **Adapt `approvals.py` for Themed Console:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/core/approvals.py` to use the themed console and semantic styles.
6.  **Commit Initial Theming Implementation:**
    *   Committed changes with hash `f53ac68`.
7.  **Identify and Diagnose `MissingStyle` Error:**
    *   User ran `CLI_THEME=light qx` and encountered `rich.errors.MissingStyle: Failed to get style 'prompt.border'`.
    *   Diagnosed that style keys like `prompt.border` were used in `approvals.py` but not defined in `CLI_THEMES` in `constants.py`.
8.  **Add Missing Prompt Styles to Themes:**
    *   Added `prompt.border`, `prompt.choices.key`, and `prompt.invalid` style definitions to both "dark" and "light" themes in `src/qx/core/constants.py`.
9.  **Commit Missing Styles Fix:**
    *   Committed changes with hash `3c82128`.
10. **Identify and Fix Literal Style Tags in Approval Prompt:**
    *   User observed that style tags like `[prompt.choices.key]` were appearing as literal text in the approval prompt.
    *   Diagnosed that the `Text` object for the prompt was not being constructed in a way that Rich would parse the embedded markup within the choices string.
11. **Refactor Approval Prompt Construction:**
    *   Modified `_ask_confirmation` in `src/qx/core/approvals.py`.
    *   The `full_prompt_text` (a `Text` object) is now built by appending styled segments for each part of the choice display (e.g., `display_text`, `[KEY]`, `/`), ensuring Rich correctly applies the `prompt.choices.key` style to the key letters.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the fix for the approval prompt display.
*   Thoroughly test theme switching and ensure all outputs, especially approval prompts, are styled correctly.
