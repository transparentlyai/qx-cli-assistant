# Project QX Log

## Session 2024-07-29

**Goal:** Implement multiline input mode in `qx/cli/qprompt.py` based on `~/projects/q/q/cli/qprompt.py`.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Retrieved Reference Implementation:**
    *   Attempted to read `../../q/q/cli/qprompt.py` (failed due to relative path interpretation).
    *   Successfully read `/home/mauro/projects/q/q/cli/qprompt.py`.

2.  **Retrieved Target File:**
    *   Read the current content of `src/qx/cli/qprompt.py`.

3.  **Integrated Multiline Functionality:**
    *   Defined new prompt string constants for single-line, auto-approve, and multiline modes (`QX_FIXED_PROMPT_TEXT`, `QX_AUTO_APPROVE_PROMPT_TEXT`, `QX_MULTILINE_PROMPT_TEXT`, `QX_MULTILINE_HINT_TEXT`) and their `FormattedText` equivalents.
    *   Introduced `is_multiline: List[bool]` to track multiline state, allowing modification within key binding closures.
    *   Added `current_prompt_formatted: List[Any]` to dynamically hold the current prompt's `FormattedText` object.
    *   Implemented key bindings:
        *   `c-m` (Enter): Inserts `\n` if `is_multiline[0]` is true, otherwise calls `event.app.current_buffer.validate_and_handle()`.
        *   `escape, c-m` (Alt+Enter): Toggles `is_multiline[0]`.
            *   When turning multiline OFF: Sets the prompt to the appropriate single-line version (normal or auto-approve) and calls `event.app.current_buffer.validate_and_handle()` to submit.
            *   When turning multiline ON: Sets the prompt to `QX_MULTILINE_PROMPT_FORMATTED` and inserts an initial `\n` into the buffer, matching the reference behavior.
        *   `c-c` (Ctrl+C): Calls `event.app.exit(exception=KeyboardInterrupt())` for a cleaner exit from the prompt, which `get_user_input` now handles by returning an empty string.
    *   Modified the `session.prompt` call to use a `lambda: current_prompt_formatted[0]` to allow the prompt to change dynamically.
    *   Ensured `is_multiline[0]` is reset to `False` at the beginning of each `get_user_input` call.
    *   Updated the `KeyboardInterrupt` handler in `get_user_input` to return an empty string, and the `EOFError` handler to return "exit".
    *   Refined the `__main__` test block to reflect the new multiline capabilities and prompt constants.
    *   Corrected history parsing logic for commands without explicit timestamp or `+` prefix to treat the entire line as a command.
    *   Ensured `current_prompt_formatted` is initialized correctly based on `approval_manager` status before the prompt session starts.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/cli/qprompt.py`: Implemented multiline input, dynamic prompt updates, and refined key bindings.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `a07469b` - feat: Implement multiline input and enhance prompt interactivity

## Session 2024-07-29 (Continued)

**Goal:** Ensure `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) across the entire application consistently returns the user to the input prompt.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Inspected `src/qx/main.py`:**
    *   Reviewed the main application loop in the `_async_main` function.

2.  **Modified `KeyboardInterrupt` Handling in `_async_main` (Attempt 1):**
    *   Updated the `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` block within the main `while True:` loop.
    *   Instead of `break` (which would exit the application), the handler now prints a message ("Operation cancelled. Returning to prompt...") and uses `continue` to proceed to the next loop iteration, effectively re-displaying the input prompt.
    *   Added a check after `get_user_input` to `continue` if an empty string is returned (indicating Ctrl+C during prompt input), preventing further processing of an empty command.
    *   Optionally reset `current_message_history` to `None` upon such an interruption to avoid carrying over context from a cancelled operation.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/main.py`: Updated main loop `KeyboardInterrupt` handling.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `c7e4d5f` - fix: Enhance KeyboardInterrupt handling to return to prompt

3.  **Refined `KeyboardInterrupt` Handling for Async Operations (Attempt 2):**
    *   Identified that `asyncio.run()` cancels the main task (`_async_main`) upon `KeyboardInterrupt`, leading to an `asyncio.CancelledError` within the task.
    *   Added an `except asyncio.CancelledError:` block within the main `while True:` loop in `_async_main`.
    *   This handler now also prints a message, optionally resets `current_message_history`, and uses `continue`. This prevents `_async_main` from terminating due to cancellation, which in turn stops `asyncio.run()` from re-raising the `KeyboardInterrupt` that would exit the app.
    *   The existing `except KeyboardInterrupt:` block in `_async_main` remains as a fallback for synchronous interrupts within the loop, though `asyncio.CancelledError` is the primary mechanism for handling Ctrl+C during `await` calls.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/main.py`: Added `asyncio.CancelledError` handling to the main loop.
*   `src/qx/cli/qprompt.py`: Minor refactoring and formatting changes.
*   `src/qx/core/paths.py`: Minor refactoring and formatting changes.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `a9f1698` - fix: Ensure Ctrl+C during async operations returns to prompt

## Session 2024-07-30

**Goal:** Implement a robust shell command permission system and configurable logging.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Shell Command Permission System:**
    *   **Constants:** Added `DEFAULT_APPROVED_COMMANDS` to `src/qx/core/constants.py`. `DEFAULT_PROHIBITED_COMMANDS` was already present.
    *   **ApprovalManager Enhancement (`src/qx/core/approvals.py`):**
        *   Added `fnmatch` for pattern matching.
        *   Defined `CommandPermissionStatus` and `ApprovalDecision` Literal types.
        *   Implemented `get_command_permission_status(command: str)` method to check commands against `DEFAULT_PROHIBITED_COMMANDS` and `DEFAULT_APPROVED_COMMANDS`.
        *   Modified `request_approval` method:
            *   Added `operation_type` parameter (e.g., "shell_command").
            *   Changed return type to `Tuple[ApprovalDecision, str, Optional[str]]` (decision, item, optional_modification_reason).
            *   Integrated `get_command_permission_status` for shell commands to allow/deny/prompt.
            *   Handles "Modify" (`m`) choice, prompting for a new command and reason.
    *   **ExecuteShellTool Implementation (`src/qx/tools/execute_shell.py`):**
        *   Created `ShellCommandInput` and `ShellCommandOutput` Pydantic models.
        *   Implemented `ExecuteShellTool` class:
            *   Takes `ApprovalManager` in constructor.
            *   `run` method orchestrates approval using `ApprovalManager.request_approval`.
            *   Handles the loop for command modification.
            *   Calls private `_execute_subprocess` for actual command execution via `subprocess.run`.
            *   Returns `ShellCommandOutput` with detailed results, including modification info.
    *   **Integration and Fixes:**
        *   Updated `src/qx/tools/__init__.py` to export `ExecuteShellTool`.
        *   Modified `src/qx/core/llm.py` (`initialize_llm_agent`):
            *   Instantiated `ExecuteShellTool`.
            *   Created `approved_execute_shell_tool_wrapper` to interface `ExecuteShellTool` with PydanticAI agent, handling input/output conversion (string for LLM).
            *   Updated `approved_read_file_tool` and `approved_write_file_tool` for consistent return types and approval decisions.
            *   Corrected `query_llm` to directly `await agent.run()` as it's an async method, removing incorrect `run_in_executor` usage.

2.  **Configurable Logging:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/main.py` to:
        *   Read the `QX_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable.
        *   Map string log level names (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL) to `logging` module equivalents.
        *   Default to `logging.ERROR` if the environment variable is not set or invalid.
        *   Apply the determined level in `logging.basicConfig()`.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/constants.py`: Added `DEFAULT_APPROVED_COMMANDS`.
*   `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Enhanced with shell command permission logic and modified `request_approval`.
*   `src/qx/tools/execute_shell.py`: Implemented `ExecuteShellTool` with approval workflow.
*   `src/qx/tools/__init__.py`: Updated exports.
*   `src/qx/core/llm.py`: Integrated `ExecuteShellTool`, updated tool wrappers, fixed `query_llm` async call.
*   `src/qx/main.py`: Implemented configurable logging via `QX_LOG_LEVEL` env var.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.
*   Thorough testing of shell command execution (prohibited, approved, user prompt, modification flow) and log level configuration.

## Session 2025-05-16

**Goal:** Enhance user experience with spinners, streamline file read permissions, and fix related UI bugs.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Spinner Implementation for "Thinking" State:**
    *   Added `rich` library to `pyproject.toml`.
    *   Created `src/qx/cli/console.py` with `QXConsole` class and `show_spinner` function. This module manages a global `qx_console` instance.
    *   Integrated `show_spinner` into `src/qx/main.py` to display a spinner while `query_llm` (the LLM call) is active.
    *   Ensured the global `qx_console` can be themed and is used by `ApprovalManager` for prompts.

2.  **Automatic Approval for File Read Operations:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/core/approvals.py`:
        *   Added `"read_file"` to the `OperationType` Literal.
        *   Updated the `request_approval` method to automatically approve operations with `operation_type="read_file"`. This returns `"AUTO_APPROVED"` (or `"SESSION_APPROVED"` if "Approve All" is active) without prompting the user.
    *   Updated `src/qx/tools/read_file.py`:
        *   Created `ReadFileInput` and `ReadFileOutput` Pydantic models.
        *   Implemented the `ReadFileTool` class. This tool uses the `ApprovalManager` with `operation_type="read_file"` for its approval step.
        *   The tool calls the existing `read_file_impl` function after successful (automatic) approval.
    *   Updated `src/qx/core/llm.py`:
        *   Imported and instantiated the new `ReadFileTool`.
        *   Created an `approved_read_file_tool_wrapper` function to interface the `ReadFileTool` (and its Pydantic input/output models) with the PydanticAI agent.
        *   Replaced the previous direct wrapper for `read_file_impl` in the agent's registered tools.

3.  **Spinner Interaction with Approval Prompts (UI Enhancement & Bug Fix):**
    *   **Initial Goal:** Prevent the "thinking" spinner from obscuring user prompts (e.g., from `ApprovalManager`).
    *   **Implementation in `src/qx/cli/console.py` (`QXConsole`):**
        *   Added a class attribute `_active_status: Optional[Status]` to hold the currently active spinner object.
        *   Added a class method `set_active_status(cls, status: Optional[Status])` to allow `main.py` to register/unregister the spinner.
        *   Overrode the `input()` method. This custom method:
            *   Checks if `_active_status` is set.
            *   If so, it stops the spinner (`_active_status.stop()`) before calling the underlying console's input method.
            *   A flag `_spinner_was_stopped_by_input` was introduced to manage this state.
            *   In a `finally` block, it restarts the spinner (`_active_status.start()`) if it was stopped by this method.
    *   **Integration in `src/qx/main.py`:**
        *   When `show_spinner()` is called, the returned `Status` object is registered using `QXConsole.set_active_status(spinner_object)`.
        *   After the LLM query (and the spinner's `with` block) completes, the spinner is unregistered using `QXConsole.set_active_status(None)`.
    *   **Bug Fix:** Addressed an `AttributeError: 'Status' object has no attribute 'visible'`. The logic was corrected from attempting to use a `.visible` attribute to correctly using the `status.stop()` and `status.start()` methods.

**Files Modified:**

*   `pyproject.toml`: Added `rich` as a dependency.
*   `src/qx/cli/console.py`: Implemented `QXConsole` with spinner management logic, including the `input` override to stop/start the spinner around prompts.
*   `src/qx/main.py`: Integrated the spinner display during LLM calls and registered/unregistered the spinner status with `QXConsole`.
*   `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Added the `read_file` operation type to enable automatic approval for file reading.
*   `src/qx/tools/read_file.py`: Implemented `ReadFileTool` with Pydantic models, integrating the new approval flow for reading files.
*   `src/qx/core/llm.py`: Integrated `ReadFileTool` into the PydanticAI agent.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with this session's activities.

**Commits:**
*   `337e3c8`: feat: Add rich library and implement console spinner
*   `135dde4`: feat: Implement auto-approval for file read operations
*   `74c6e3d`: fix: Hide spinner during approval prompts
*   `6aa549c`: fix: Correct spinner handling during input prompts

## Session 2025-05-17

**Goal:** Implement syntax highlighting for code output using the "vim" theme.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed Rich Documentation:**
    *   Consulted `.Q/documentation/python-rich-docs.md` to understand `rich.syntax.Syntax`.

2.  **Implemented Syntax Highlighting in `QXConsole`:**
    *   Imported `Syntax` from `rich.syntax` in `src/qx/cli/console.py`.
    *   Added a new method `print_syntax(code: str, lexer_name: str, theme: str = "vim", line_numbers: bool = True, word_wrap: bool = False, background_color: Optional[str] = None, **kwargs: Any)` to `QXConsole`.
    *   This method creates a `Syntax` object with the specified parameters (defaulting to "vim" theme and line numbers enabled) and prints it using the internal console.
    *   Refined the `input()` method in `QXConsole` to more reliably manage spinner state when stopping/starting around the input prompt.
    *   Added test cases for the new `print_syntax` method in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block of `src/qx/cli/console.py`.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/cli/console.py`: Added `print_syntax` method and test cases.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `fc019a8` - feat: Implement syntax highlighting in QXConsole

## Session 2025-05-17 (Continued)

**Goal:** Format Q Agent's responses using Rich Markdown, with "vim" theme for code blocks.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Imported `Markdown`:**
    *   Added `from rich.markdown import Markdown` to `src/qx/main.py`.

2.  **Modified Response Printing in `_async_main`:**
    *   In `src/qx/main.py`, within the `_async_main` function, when printing the agent's response (`run_result.output`), the text is now wrapped with `Markdown(run_result.output, code_theme="vim")`.
    *   This ensures that the agent's textual responses are rendered as Markdown, and any fenced code blocks within the Markdown will be syntax-highlighted using the "vim" theme.
    *   A previous commit attempt for this failed due to shell quoting issues.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/main.py`: Imported `Markdown` and updated response printing logic.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes (attempting again with corrected commit message handling if necessary).

## Session 2025-05-17 (Continued)

**Goal:** Make Markdown code block theme configurable via `QX_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME` environment variable.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Added Default Constant:**
    *   Added `DEFAULT_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME = "vim"` to `src/qx/core/constants.py`.

2.  **Updated `main.py` for Configurable Theme:**
    *   Imported `DEFAULT_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME` in `src/qx/main.py`.
    *   In `_async_main`, read the `QX_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME` environment variable.
    *   Determined `code_theme_to_use` by using the environment variable if set, otherwise falling back to `DEFAULT_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME`.
    *   Passed `code_theme_to_use` to the `Markdown(..., code_theme=code_theme_to_use)` constructor when rendering agent responses.
    *   A previous commit attempt for this failed due to shell quoting issues. The commit `819cf9d` with a simplified message was made, and a subsequent attempt to amend it with a detailed message also failed.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/constants.py`: Added `DEFAULT_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME`.
*   `src/qx/main.py`: Implemented configurable Markdown code block theme.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `819cf9d` - feat: Make Markdown code_theme configurable (Simplified message due to shell quoting issues with detailed message)

## Session 2025-05-18

**Goal:** Enhance file write approval previews to show diffs for existing files and truncated content for new files, using a configurable syntax theme.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed Reference Implementation:**
    *   Read `/home/mauro/projects/q/q/operators/write.py` to understand its diff generation (`difflib`), diff display (`rich.syntax.Syntax` with "diff" lexer), new content preview (truncation, `rich.syntax.Syntax`), and content preprocessing (stripping Markdown fences).

2.  **Updated `ApprovalManager` (`src/qx/core/approvals.py`):**
    *   Modified `__init__` to accept and store `syntax_highlight_theme` (defaulting to "vim" for standalone testing, but will be passed from `main.py`).
    *   Added `OperationType` "write_file".
    *   Created a new private method `_get_file_preview_renderable(file_path_str: str, new_content: str, operation_type: OperationType)`:
        *   If `operation_type` is "write_file":
            *   Checks if `file_path_str` exists.
            *   **If file exists**: Reads current content, generates a diff using `difflib.unified_diff`, and creates a `rich.syntax.Syntax` object with the "diff" lexer and the configured `syntax_highlight_theme`.
            *   **If file does not exist (new file)**: Applies truncation logic (e.g., 12 head lines, 12 tail lines, "more lines" message if > 30 total lines) to `new_content`. Creates a `rich.syntax.Syntax` object using the file extension for the lexer and the configured `syntax_highlight_theme`.
        *   If `operation_type` is "generic" and `content_preview` is provided, it uses the existing simple text truncation.
    *   Modified `request_approval`:
        *   When `operation_type` is "write_file" and `content_preview` (new full content) is provided, it calls `_get_file_preview_renderable` to get the diff or truncated new content display.
        *   The returned `Syntax` or `Text` object is then included in the approval panel.
        *   Ensured "Modify" option is available for "write_file" operations, allowing the user to change the target path.

3.  **Updated `main.py` (`src/qx/main.py`):**
    *   When `ApprovalManager` is instantiated in `_async_main`, the `code_theme_to_use` (already determined from `QX_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME` or `DEFAULT_SYNTAX_HIGHLIGHT_THEME`) is passed to the `ApprovalManager`'s `syntax_highlight_theme` parameter.
    *   Commit `412d168` for these changes was successful, despite some benign stderr messages from the shell.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Implemented diff and truncated new content previews for write operations.
*   `src/qx/main.py`: Passed configured syntax theme to `ApprovalManager`.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `412d168` - feat: Enhance write approval with diff and truncation previews

## Session 2025-05-18 (Continued)

**Goal:** Refine new file preview in `ApprovalManager` to correctly display truncated, syntax-highlighted content.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Reviewed `src/qx/core/approvals.py`:**
    *   Examined `_get_file_preview_renderables` and its usage in `request_approval`.

2.  **Refined `ApprovalManager` (`src/qx/core/approvals.py`):**
    *   **In `_get_file_preview_renderables` (for new files):**
        *   Ensured `lexer_name` defaults to "text" if the file extension is empty or the lexer is not found (using `pygments.lexers.get_lexer_by_name` and `pygments.util.ClassNotFound`).
        *   Modified the method to return a `List[RenderableType]` instead of `Optional[Syntax | Text]`. This list will contain the `Syntax` object for the code and, if truncated, a separate `Text` object for the truncation message.
        *   The truncation message itself was slightly restyled for clarity (e.g., `[dim i]... X more lines ...[/dim i]`).
    *   **In `request_approval`:**
        *   Imported `Group` from `rich.console`.
        *   When constructing the panel content, `panel_content_renderables` (which is a `List[RenderableType]`) is now passed to `Group(*panel_content_renderables)` if it contains multiple items. This `Group` (or the single renderable if only one) is then used as the content for the `Panel`. This ensures Rich handles the layout of multiple renderables (like Syntax + Text) correctly.
    *   Updated the `__main__` block with more specific test cases for new file previews, including unknown extensions.
    *   Commit `c5876d9` for these changes was successful, despite some benign stderr messages from the shell.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Improved new file preview logic, lexer handling, and panel content assembly using `Group`.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `c5876d9` - fix: Correct new file preview rendering in ApprovalManager

## Session 2025-05-18 (Continued)

**Goal:** Fix `NameError: name 'content_preview' is not defined` in `ApprovalManager._get_file_preview_renderables`.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Identified Error:** The `NameError` occurred because `_get_file_preview_renderables` was trying to access `content_preview` in its `elif operation_type == "generic"` block, but `content_preview` was not a parameter of this internal method. The actual content for generic previews is passed as the second argument to `_get_file_preview_renderables`.

2.  **Corrected `ApprovalManager` (`src/qx/core/approvals.py`):**
    *   Renamed the second parameter of `_get_file_preview_renderables` from `new_content` to `operation_content_for_preview` to better reflect its dual role (new file content for "write_file", or generic preview string for "generic").
    *   Updated the logic within `_get_file_preview_renderables` to use this `operation_content_for_preview` parameter consistently for both "write_file" (as new content) and "generic" (as the preview string) operation types.
    *   In `request_approval`, when calling `_get_file_preview_renderables`, the `content_preview` (from `request_approval`'s parameters) is now correctly passed as the second argument (`operation_content_for_preview`) to `_get_file_preview_renderables`.
    *   Commit `8adf402` for these changes was successful.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Corrected parameter handling in `_get_file_preview_renderables` to resolve the `NameError`.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `8adf402` - fix: Resolve NameError in ApprovalManager's preview logic

## Session 2025-05-18 (Continued)

**Goal:** Ensure file write previews use `rich.syntax.Syntax` by correctly setting `operation_type` in the `approved_write_file_tool` wrapper.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Identified Issue:** The `approved_write_file_tool` in `src/qx/core/llm.py` was calling `approval_manager.request_approval` with `operation_type="generic"`. This caused the `ApprovalManager` to use simple text truncation for the preview instead of the intended diff/syntax highlighting logic for file writes.

2.  **Modified `src/qx/core/llm.py`:**
    *   In the `approved_write_file_tool` function, changed the `operation_type` argument in the call to `approval_manager.request_approval` from `"generic"` to `"write_file"`.
    *   Ensured `allow_modify=True` is set for this call to allow path modification.
    *   Commit `41a0a48` for these changes was successful.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/llm.py`: Updated `approved_write_file_tool` to use `operation_type="write_file"`.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `41a0a48` - fix: Use 'write_file' operation_type for correct approval previews

## Session 2025-05-18 (Continued)

**Goal:** Fix `TypeError: Syntax.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'lexer_name'` for new file previews.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Identified Error:** The `TypeError` occurred because `rich.syntax.Syntax` expects the lexer name as its second positional argument, but it was being passed as a keyword argument `lexer_name=...` in `_get_file_preview_renderables` for new files.

2.  **Corrected `ApprovalManager` (`src/qx/core/approvals.py`):**
    *   Modified the instantiation of `Syntax` objects within `_get_file_preview_renderables` for new file previews.
    *   Changed `Syntax(display_content, lexer_name=lexer_name, ...)` to `Syntax(display_content, lexer_name, ...)`, passing the `lexer_name` as the correct positional argument.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Corrected `Syntax` instantiation for new file previews.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.

## Session 2025-05-18 (Continued)

**Goal:** Align LLM tool wrapper names with system prompt references.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Identified Issue:** The system prompt refers to tools by their base names (e.g., `read_file`, `write_file`, `execute_shell`), but the wrapper functions in `llm.py` had `approved_` prefixes and `_wrapper` suffixes.

2.  **Modified `src/qx/core/llm.py`:**
    *   Renamed `approved_read_file_tool_wrapper` to `read_file`.
    *   Renamed `approved_write_file_tool` to `write_file`.
    *   Renamed `approved_execute_shell_tool_wrapper` to `execute_shell`.
    *   Updated the `registered_tools` list to use these new function names. This ensures that the Pydantic-AI agent registers the tools with names the LLM expects based on the system prompt.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/core/llm.py`: Renamed tool wrapper functions to match system prompt references.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Commit:** `7fb6393` - Refactor: Rename LLM tool wrappers for prompt compatibility

## Session 2025-05-19

**Goal:** Display QX version and model information on startup.

**Key Activities:**

1.  **Read `pyproject.toml`:**
    *   Confirmed QX version is "0.3.2".

2.  **Modified `src/qx/main.py`:**
    *   Added a `QX_VERSION` constant (currently hardcoded as "0.3.2", with a comment noting it should ideally be sourced from the package).
    *   Imported `Text` from `rich.text`.
    *   After `initialize_llm_agent` completes and the agent is confirmed not `None`:
        *   Constructed an info string: `f"QX ver: {QX_VERSION} - brain: {model_name_from_env}"`.
        *   Printed this string using `qx_console.print(Text(info_text, style="dim"))`.
        *   Added `qx_console.print()` for a blank line after the info message for better visual spacing.

**Files Modified:**

*   `src/qx/main.py`: Implemented display of QX version and model name on startup.
*   `.Q/projectlog.md`: Updated with session activities.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit the changes.
