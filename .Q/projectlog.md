# Project QX Log

## Session 2024-07-16
**Goal:** Add Rich CLI themes to constants.

**Activities:**

1.  **Read Rich Documentation:** User requested to read `.Q/documentation/python-rich-docs.md`.
    *   Q Agent Action: `read .Q/documentation/python-rich-docs.md`
    *   Outcome: Successfully read and presented documentation snippets.
2.  **Discuss Rich Theming:** User inquired about Rich's theming capabilities.
    *   Q Agent Action: Provided an explanation and example of Rich theming.
3.  **Add CLI Themes to Constants:** User requested to add comprehensive "dark" and "light" themes to `src/qx/core/constants.py` under a dictionary `CLI_THEMES`.
    *   Q Agent Action (initial): `read src/qx/core/constants.py`
    *   Q Agent Action (write): Wrote `CLI_THEMES` with keys "dark_background" and "light_background".
    *   User Feedback: Requested keys to be "dark" and "light".
    *   Q Agent Action (correction): `read src/qx/core/constants.py` (to get the just-written content for modification, though in this case it was a direct re-write based on previous state + new themes).
    *   Q Agent Action (write): Correctly wrote `CLI_THEMES` with keys "dark" and "light" to `src/qx/core/constants.py`.
    *   Outcome: `src/qx/core/constants.py` updated successfully with the new themes.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit changes.
*   Continue development based on user requests.

**Goal:** Initialize project and set up core files.

**Activities:**

1.  **Initial Project Setup:** (Simulated - Q Agent started with existing project structure)
2.  **Review Project Directives:** Q Agent internally reviewed project directives from `.Q/project.md` and environment context.
3.  **Read Project Log:** Q Agent read `.Q/projectlog.md` (empty at the start of this session).
4.  **Create `src/qx/core/constants.py`:**
    *   Added `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_TREE_IGNORE_PATTERNS`, `DEFAULT_PROHIBITED_COMMANDS`, `SHELL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`.
    *   Added placeholder default settings for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI, and Groq.
5.  **Commit initial constants:**
    *   `git add .`
    *   `git diff --staged` (analyzed by Q Agent)
    *   `git commit -m "feat: Add initial core constants\n\n- Define DEFAULT_MODEL for LLM selection.\n- Establish DEFAULT_TREE_IGNORE_PATTERNS for file navigation.\n- List DEFAULT_PROHIBITED_COMMANDS for shell safety.\n- Set SHELL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT for command execution.\n- Include placeholder default configurations for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Groq)."`

**Next Steps:**
*   Implement further core functionalities.
