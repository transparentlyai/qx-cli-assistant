# Project QX Log

## Session 2024-07-19 (Ongoing)
**Goal:** Implement selectable Rich CLI themes.

**Activities:**

1.  **Add `DEFAULT_CLI_THEME` Constant:**
    *   Added `DEFAULT_CLI_THEME = "dark"` to `src/qx/core/constants.py`.
    *   This sets the default theme if the `CLI_THEME` environment variable is not specified.
2.  **Implement Theme Loading in `main.py`:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/main.py` (`_async_main` function).
    *   Logic added to read the `CLI_THEME` environment variable.
    *   If `CLI_THEME` is set and valid (exists in `CLI_THEMES` from `constants.py`), it's used.
    *   If invalid or not set, `DEFAULT_CLI_THEME` is used.
    *   The global `q_console` instance is re-initialized with the selected `Theme` object.
    *   Error handling for invalid theme names or issues applying the theme.
    *   Passed the themed `q_console` instance to `initialize_llm_agent` and `query_llm`.
3.  **Adapt `llm.py` for Themed Console:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/core/llm.py`.
    *   Removed its module-level `q_console`.
    *   `initialize_llm_agent` and `query_llm` now accept a `console: RichConsole` parameter.
    *   Internal print statements and `ApprovalManager` instantiation now use the passed-in themed console.
4.  **Adapt `qprompt.py` for Themed Console:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/cli/qprompt.py`.
    *   Ensured `get_user_input` accepts `console: RichConsole`.
    *   Noted that `prompt_toolkit` handles its own prompt string styling, but the passed console would be used for any other messages printed by this module.
5.  **Adapt `approvals.py` for Themed Console:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/core/approvals.py`.
    *   `ApprovalManager`'s `__init__` accepts `console: Optional[RichConsole]`.
    *   Updated internal print statements to use semantic styles (e.g., `[warning]`, `[info]`, `[success]`, `[error]`, `[prompt]`) which will be resolved by the theme applied to the console instance.

**Next Steps:**

*   Commit changes.
*   Thoroughly test theme switching via `CLI_THEME` environment variable and ensure all outputs are styled correctly.

**Goal:** Add Rich CLI themes to constants.

**Activities:**

1.  **Read Rich Documentation:** User requested to read `.Q/documentation/python-rich-docs.md`.
    *   Q Agent Action: `read .Q/documentation/python-rich-docs.md`
    *   Outcome: Successfully read and presented documentation snippets.
2.  **Discuss Rich Theming:** User inquired about Rich's theming capabilities.
    *   Q Agent Action: Provided an explanation and example of Rich theming.
3.  **Add CLI Themes to Constants:** User requested to add comprehensive "dark" and "light" themes to `src/qx/core/constants.py` under a dictionary `CLI_THEMES`.
    *   Q Agent Action (initial): `read src/qx/core/constants.py`
    *   Q Agent Action (write): Wrote `CLI_THEMES` with keys "dark_background" and "light_background".
    *   User Feedback: Requested keys to be "dark" and "light".
    *   Q Agent Action (correction): `read src/qx/core/constants.py`.
    *   Q Agent Action (write): Correctly wrote `CLI_THEMES` with keys "dark" and "light" to `src/qx/core/constants.py`.
    *   Outcome: `src/qx/core/constants.py` updated successfully with the new themes.
4.  **Commit Theme Constants:**
    *   Updated `.Q/projectlog.md`.
    *   Committed changes with hash `aed1e3b`.

**Next Steps:**
*   Implement selectable Rich CLI themes.

**Goal:** Initialize project and set up core files.

**Activities:**

1.  **Initial Project Setup:** (Simulated - Q Agent started with existing project structure)
2.  **Review Project Directives:** Q Agent internally reviewed project directives from `.Q/project.md` and environment context.
3.  **Read Project Log:** Q Agent read `.Q/projectlog.md` (empty at the start of this session).
4.  **Create `src/qx/core/constants.py`:**
    *   Added `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `DEFAULT_TREE_IGNORE_PATTERNS`, `DEFAULT_PROHIBITED_COMMANDS`, `SHELL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT`.
    *   Added placeholder default settings for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Vertex AI, and Groq.
5.  **Commit initial constants:**
    *   `git add .`
    *   `git diff --staged` (analyzed by Q Agent)
    *   `git commit -m "feat: Add initial core constants\n\n- Define DEFAULT_MODEL for LLM selection.\n- Establish DEFAULT_TREE_IGNORE_PATTERNS for file navigation.\n- List DEFAULT_PROHIBITED_COMMANDS for shell safety.\n- Set SHELL_COMMAND_TIMEOUT for command execution.\n- Include placeholder default configurations for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex AI, Groq)."`

**Next Steps:**
*   Implement further core functionalities.
