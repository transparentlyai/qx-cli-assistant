# Project QX Log

## Session 2024-05-21

**Goal:** Resolve `rich.errors.MissingStyle` error and continue development.

**Activities:**

*   **Error Diagnosis:** User reported `rich.errors.MissingStyle: Failed to get style 'prompt.border'` when running `qx`. The traceback indicated the error originated in `src/qx/core/approvals.py` when trying to use `border_style="prompt.border"` for a Rich `Panel`.
*   **Investigation:**
    *   Checked `src/qx/cli/console.py`: Found that `QXConsole` was initialized with a standard Rich `Console` without any custom themes that would define "prompt.border".
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Modified `src/qx/core/approvals.py`: Changed `border_style="prompt.border"` to `border_style="blue"` (a standard Rich color/style) on line 305.
*   **Refactoring (Staged with Fix):**
    *   The `git diff --staged` revealed that a larger refactoring related to CLI theming was also included in the staged changes. This involved:
        *   Removing the custom CLI theming system (`CLI_THEMES`, `DEFAULT_CLI_THEME` from `src/qx/core/constants.py`).
        *   Removing theme loading and application logic from `src/qx/main.py`.
        *   Simplifying `src/qx/cli/console.py` by removing `apply_theme` and related test code.
        *   Removing the `QX_VERSION` constant from `src/qx/main.py`.
*   **Commit:** Committed the fix and the associated refactoring with a detailed message. (Commit `fe54705`)

**Next Steps:** User to test `qx` to confirm the error is resolved.
