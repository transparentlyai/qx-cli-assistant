Refactor: Improve fzf history display for multiline entries

- Refactored history parsing logic to correctly group multiline commands starting with '+' in `_show_history_fzf_event`.
- Added logic to parse timestamps from both `strftime` and `prompt_toolkit` formats.
- Replaced newline characters in `fzf` display with ' â†µ '.
- Ensured original command with newlines is inserted into prompt buffer.
- Handled cases without timestamps or manual history entries.
- Removed unused `shlex` import.
- Updated `if __name__ == '__main__':` with comprehensive test history data.
