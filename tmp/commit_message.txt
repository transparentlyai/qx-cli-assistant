fix: Enhance KeyboardInterrupt handling to return to prompt

Modified the main application loop in `src/qx/main.py` to improve `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) resilience.

- The `KeyboardInterrupt` exception handler within the main `while True:` loop in `_async_main` now directs the application to `continue` to the next iteration. This returns the user to the input prompt instead of exiting the application when an operation (e.g., LLM query) is interrupted.
- Added a condition after `get_user_input` to check for an empty string result (which `qx/cli/qprompt.py` returns if Ctrl+C is pressed during input). If an empty string is received, the loop continues, re-displaying the prompt.
- `current_message_history` is now reset to `None` if an operation is cancelled by `KeyboardInterrupt` to prevent carrying over potentially incomplete context.
- Updated `.Q/projectlog.md` to document these changes.
