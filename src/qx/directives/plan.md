# Plan a feature or refactoring implementation

1. Examine the relevant code or project documentation.
2. Analyze requirements - Understand the full scope and constraints
3. Identify dependencies - Map out what needs to be done first
4. Create milestones - Define clear, measurable checkpoints
5. Estimate effort - Provide rough time estimates for each component
6. Risk assessment - Highlight potential blockers or challenges

Format the plan as a structured list with clear priorities and dependencies marked.
For large plans break it into phases or iterations.
